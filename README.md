# FSND-Project1
# Simple project to create a static website featuring favourite movies.
# entertainment_center holds the list of movies (actually IMDB_IDs) that are used to search the OMDB using their API and then uses the title from OMDB
# to query Youtube for the trailer's youtube video id. Once all of that is placed in the instance of the movie class. A list of the instances is passed
# to fresh_tomatoes that displays it in webpage. There's some customization there to show additional info, provide an IMDB link, and make it just a bit
# more interactive.
